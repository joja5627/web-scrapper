### `/cmd`

Main applications for this project.

The directory name for each application should match the name of the executable you want to have (e.g., `/cmd/myapp`).

Don't put a lot of code in the application directory. If you think the code can be imported and used in other projects, then it should live in the `/pkg` directory. If the code is not reusable or if you don't want others to reuse it, put that code in the `/internal` directory. You'll be surprised what others will do, so be explicit about your intentions!

It's common to have a small `main` function that imports and invokes the code from the `/internal` and `/pkg` directories and nothing else.

### `/internal`

Private application and library code. This is the code you don't want others importing in their applications or libraries.

Put your actual application code in the `/internal/app` directory (e.g., `/internal/app/myapp`) and the code shared by those apps in the `/internal/pkg` directory (e.g., `/internal/pkg/myprivlib`).

### `/pkg`

Library code that's ok to use by external applications (e.g., `/pkg/mypubliclib`). Other projects will import these libraries expecting them to work, so think twice before you put something here :-)

It's also a way to group Go code in one place when your root directory contains lots of non-Go components and directories making it easier to run various Go tools (as mentioned in the [`Best Practices for Industrial Programming`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTE4VJIdHPg) from GopherCon EU 2018).

### `/vendor`

Application dependencies (managed manually or by your favorite dependency management tool like [`dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep)).

Don't commit your application dependencies if you are building a library.

## Service Application Directories

### `/api`

OpenAPI/Swagger specs, JSON schema files, protocol definition files.

## Web Application Directories

### `/web`

Web application specific components: static web assets, server side templates and SPAs.

## Common Application Directories

### `/configs`

Configuration file templates or default configs.

Put your `confd` or `consul-template` template files here.

### `/init`

System init (systemd, upstart, sysv) and process manager/supervisor (runit, supervisord) configs.

### `/scripts`

Scripts to perform various build, install, analysis, etc operations.

These scripts keep the root level Makefile small and simple (e.g., `https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/Makefile`).

### `/build`

Packaging and Continuous Integration.

Put your cloud (AMI), container (Docker), OS (deb, rpm, pkg) package configurations and scripts in the `/build/package` directory.

Put your CI (travis, circle, drone) configurations and scripts in the `/build/ci` directory. Note that some of the CI tools (e.g., Travis CI) are very picky about the location of their config files. Try putting the config files in the `/build/ci` directory linking them to the location where the CI tools expect them (when possible).

### `/deployments`

IaaS, PaaS, system and container orchestration deployment configurations and templates (docker-compose, kubernetes/helm, mesos, terraform, bosh).

### `/test`

Additional external test apps and test data. Feel free to structure the `/test` directory anyway you want. For bigger projects it makes sense to have a data subdirectory. For example, you can have `/test/data` or `/test/testdata` if you need Go to ignore what's in that directory. Note that Go will also ignore directories or files that begin with "." or "_", so you have more flexibility in terms of how you name your test data directory.


## Other Directories

### `/docs`

Design and user documents (in addition to your godoc generated documentation).


### `/tools`

Supporting tools for this project. Note that these tools can import code from the `/pkg` and `/internal` directories.


### `/examples`

Examples for your applications and/or public libraries.


### `/third_party`

External helper tools, forked code and other 3rd party utilities (e.g., Swagger UI).

### `/githooks`

Git hooks.

### `/assets`

Other assets to go along with your repository (images, logos, etc).

### `/website`

This is the place to put your project's website data if you are not using Github pages.
